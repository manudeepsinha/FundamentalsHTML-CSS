			<div> <!--Starting of how I got to know about the novel-->
				I first got to know about alchemy when I was playing <a href="https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Alchemy_(Skyrim)">Skyrim.</a>
				Though I'm not an avid reader, but I would hugely recommend to read The Alchemist atleast once. This book was gifted by my girlfriend
				and it surely changed my perspective on so many aspects of life.

				<br> <!--My thoughts-->
				I genuienly loved the storytelling which kept me up for hours reading it. I can find wisdom, and flow of philosophy in every other page. The story is mesmerising and filled with optimism. We tend to focus on destination so much that we often neglect the joy of the journey itself. I love how the book emphasizes on the importance of faith, hope, and spirituality through the story of an ordinary boy. The best thing about the book is that everyone, irrespective of the age, can relate to the young boy as we all have dreams, and watching him, the boy, leaving everything behind just to live his destiny is really worth the read! Overall, I think <em>The Alchemist</em> deserves a space in everyone's bookshelf.

				<h3>Some great quotes from the book</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting.</li>
					<li>When we love, we always strive to become better than we are. When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too.</li>
					<li>There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.</li>
					<li>The secret of life, though, is to fall seven times and to get up eight times.</li>
					<li>Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own.</li>
					<li>Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second's encounter with God and with eternity.</li>
				</ul>
